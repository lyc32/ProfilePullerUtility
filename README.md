## Title: Create Profile Puller Utility

### Description: As a developer, I want to create a profile puller utility that retrieves user profiles from the GitHub API using the fetch method. The utility should display the retrieved profiles in a visually appealing manner using HTML and Bootstrap.

### Acceptance Criteria:

- The utility should have a text input field to enter a GitHub username.
- Upon submitting a username, the utility should retrieve the user's profile data from the GitHub API using the fetch method.
- The retrieved profile data should be displayed in a visually appealing manner, utilizing HTML and Bootstrap.
- The displayed profile should include the user's name, profile picture, bio, number of followers, and number of repositories.
- If the username does not exist or an error occurs during the API request, an appropriate error message should be displayed.
- The utility should be responsive and mobile-friendly, with a clean and user-friendly design.
- The utility should be tested on multiple browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.
- The code should be well-organized, modular, and follow best practices for readability and maintainability.

Additional Information:

- The GitHub API documentation can be found at https://docs.github.com/en/rest/.
- Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript libraries can be utilized to enhance the visual design and responsiveness of the utility.
- The utility should be developed using modern web development technologies, such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
- The code should be version-controlled using Git, with regular commits and appropriate branch management.
